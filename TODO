Output in D8 ArcGIS (Debasish Pal <debasish_pal@sutd.edu.sg>):
Sorry Richard. I misunderstood. I would like to receive the format as in ArcGIS flow direction coding (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 in clockwise direction)


# Add two addtional methods.
# MFD with square root (Katy will send either a paper or derrivation to Richard)

# change proportion ordering so that proportions are listed in math order of index
# center, E, NE, N, NW, W, SW, S, SE

# option 1
flow_proportions = rd.CalculateProportions(dem, method='D8')
ts = rd.TopologicSort(flow_proportions)
# ts would be an object with these attributes
ts.queue
ts.levels
accum = rd.FlowAccumGeneric(ts, flow_proportions)

#option 2
accum = rd.FlowAccumulation(dem, method='D8')

Topographic Wetness Index
