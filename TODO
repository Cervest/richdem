Beyond these kinds of relationships and the ensuing impacts, the
decisions made about unwanted depressions (i.e. spurious pits or
sinks) will have a large impact on the subsequent analysis and
interpretation of the results of geomorphometric analysis. Two
approaches have found frequent use â€” one relies on progressively
filling the sinks by increasing their elevation values until the elevation
of their lowest outflow point is reached (e.g. Jenson and Domingue,
1988; Martz and de Jong, 1988; Soille and Gratin, 1994; Planchon and
Darboux, 2001; Wang and Liu, 2006), whereas the second method
creates a descending path from the bottom of the sink by carving the
terrain along this path until the nearest point is reached which has an
elevation lower than the bottom of the sink (e.g. Morris and
Heerdegen, 1988; Rieger, 1992; Martz and Garbrecht, 1999; Soille
et al., 2003; Soille, 2004). However, Reuter et al. (2009) recently used
both of these approaches along with one that combined sink filling
and carving such that the sum of the differences in elevation between
the input DEMs and the output DEMs that did not have sinks were
minimized. This combined approach produced superior results for the
Baranja Hill study catchment in Croatia [see Grimaldi et al. (2007)
for an alternative physically-based approach]. Lindsay and Creed
(2005a,b, 2006) have also combined elements of the aforementioned
approaches and used them to distinguish artifact and real depressions
in digital elevation data and to propose a minimum impact approach
for removing the artifact depressions in relatively flat landscapes like
those occurring on the Canadian Shield.
