The customization procedure is as follows:
Copy the <ArcGIS>\ArcToolbox\Stylesheets\MdDlgContent.xsl to another folder (<ArcGIS> is the ArcGIS install directory). You can rename it if you like, as long as you keep the .xsl extension.
Modify the style sheet using a text editor such as Notepad. Do not use a word processor such as Word unless you understand how to save the file as raw text. Instructions on how to modify the style sheet can be found below.
In ArcToolbox, right-click a tool and click Properties. On the General tab, enter the location of your new style sheet in the Stylesheet control. If the location is empty, the default style sheet will be used.
You can also customize MdDlgHelp.xsl, which is the style sheet applied to the Help panel of the tool's dialog box, by using the same procedure as above. If you have a modified Help style sheet, you enter both the Content style sheet and the Help style sheet in the tool's property dialog, separating them with a semicolon. The path to the Content style sheet must come first. If you only want to apply a customized Help style sheet, simply place a semicolon in place of the Content style sheet and the default MdDlgContent.xsl will be used. When just the Content style sheet is modified, a semicolon is not necessary to make sure the default MdDlgHelp.xsl is applied.
