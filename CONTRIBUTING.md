Project Description
-------------------

RichDEM is a set of digital elevation model (DEM) hydrologic analysis tools.
RichDEM uses parallel processing and state of the art algorithms to quickly
process even very large DEMs.

RichDEM offers a variety of flow metrics, such as D8 and Dâˆž. It can flood or
breach depressions. It can calculate flow accumulation, slops, curvatures, &c.

RichDEM is available as a performant C++ library, a low-dependency Python
package, and a set of command-line tools.
