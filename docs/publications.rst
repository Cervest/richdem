Specific Algorithms
===================
Many of the algorithms used in RichDEM are documented in journal or conference
publications. In the case of older algorithms by other authors, it is often
possible to find the paper in the literature. Some of the newer algorithms I
developed have not yet had a chance to be widely utilized. These algorithms are
listed below.

Additionally, each publication has its own GitHub repository featuring
easily-compiled, minimum working examples of the algorithms, along with examples
and test data sets.

These are available as follows:

 * Flat-resolution algorithm. `Link <https://github.com/r-barnes/Barnes2013-FlatSurfaces>`_
 * Depression-filling algorithm. `Link <https://github.com/r-barnes/Barnes2013-Depressions>`_
 * Large dataset depression-filling algorithm. `Link <https://github.com/r-barnes/Barnes2016-ParallelPriorityFlood>`_
 * Large dataset flow accumulation algorithm. `Link <https://github.com/r-barnes/Barnes2016-ParallelFlowAccum>`_
